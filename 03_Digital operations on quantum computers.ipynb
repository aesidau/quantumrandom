    "Generating random numbers from a variety of specific probability distributions shows us how the quantum state vector reflects the desired probability distribution. However, quantum computers can simulate a digital computer also. Even though bits are certain and qubits are uncertain, computing on a digital computer can be thought of like working with a special kind of probability distribution: one where there is a row on the state vector with a 100% probability, and all the rest are zero. This reflects how digital computers are deterministic.\n",

    "We have already seen the CX, or \"constrained swap\", operation. There is a simpler one called the X operation which does a swap within of *all* pairs of rows in the state vector where the only difference is in a specific qubit. So, where the CX operation required specifying two qubits to determine the rows it affects, the X operation requires just specifying just one qubit. Where you might think of CX as a \"constrained swap\", you can think of X as just a \"swap\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first X swaps the first two rows, as these differ only in qubit 0 (the rightmost qubit), and while it also swaps the second two rows, these were the same, so we don't see a difference there. The second X swaps rows $|01\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$, as these differ only in qubit 1 (the leftmost qubit), and while it also swaps the remaining two rows, again these were the same value, so we don't see any difference after the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CCX operation\n",
    "Now that we know about X and CX, you might be wondering if there are more constraints that can be added to X. Yes, a common operation is a \"doubly constrained\" version of X, sometimes known as a [Toffoli operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCX operation is constrained to operate only on pairs of rows where two specified qubits are $|1\\rangle$, and it swaps pairs of rows where only a third qubit changes, i.e. a \"doubly constrained swap\" operation. Here's what some CCX operations look like on a state vector consisting of three qubits:\n",

In the above table, as it is starting to get long, next to the qubits identifier for the row, I've also written the row number in brackets. The qubits identifier is a binary number, and corresponds to a decimal number, which is the row number, e.g. $011$ is the binary number for $3$, so I've written this as $|011\\rangle$ ($|3\\rangle$).\n",

The first time this operation is performed, both of those rows are $0.0$, so it looks like nothing happens, but the second time, we see the effect of the swap performed."

    "### Incrementing a 3-bit number\n",
    "A very common operation on a digital computer is incrementing a number, or in other words, adding one to it. Incrementing 3 results in 4, incrementing 6 results in 7, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the state vector represents a different number, i.e. the decimal number corresponding to the binary number for that arrangement of qubits. For a state vector that represents 3 qubits, row $|100\\rangle$ is row $|4\\rangle$, while row $|110\\rangle$ is row $|6\\rangle$. Incrementing a number can be thought of as taking a state vector with a specific number encoded in it - the row with 100% probability - and turning it into a state vector with a new number encoded in it, specifically the original number plus one. For example, if we start with a state vector with row $|4\\rangle$ with 100% probability, incrementing this would result in a new state vector with row $|5\\rangle$ having 100% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this sort of algorithm, where a row has 100% probabiltiy, and we make another row 100% probability, we simply need to use variants of the X operation. The X, CX and CCX operations only swap rows around, so will always leave the state vector having a single row with 100% probability. In this case, they can simulate the deterministic operations of a digital computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increment a number encoded on the state vector using variants of the X operation, it is quite straightforward, but we need to think about it in binary notation. If we add one to a number ending in $|0\\rangle$, it will either become $|1\\rangle$, or it will become $|0\\rangle$ and carry a one to the next place. To achieve this, we can use X to swap from a $|0\\rangle$ row to a $|1\\rangle$ row, or visa versa, and a CX to manage the carrying of the one. Similarly, we can use a CCX to manage the carrying of the one to the final place.\n",
