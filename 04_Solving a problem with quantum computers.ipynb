    "Generating random numbers from a variety of specific probability distributions is interesting, and so is implementing digital computer operations on a quantum computer so that multiple operations are performed simulaneously. However neither of these is enough to justify the hype around quantum computers. Let's now take a look at an example of something where quantum computers can significantly outperform digital computers. It's known as [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm), and allows a quantum computer to take a function that might be performed on digital computers, and wrap it in some quantum goodness that quickly solves for it. Specifically, the function is a type where it has one (or just a couple) of solutions, and where the approach to solve for it on a digital computer would be to \"brute force\" the answer by trying every possible solution to check if it works. On a quantum computer, there are some tricks to try the function fewer times, or even just once, and yet still figure out the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions of this type, that have one specific solution, exist all over the place. So, this is a potentially highly useful application for quantum computers. For example, a function that checks a possible set of numbers to a particular [Sudoku puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) to confirm if it is a correct solution, a function that checks a password to see if it matches an encrypted password entry for a user, or a function that confirms the colour of a particular pixel in an image is correct for a given 3D scene with a particular set of objects and lighting. Many different problems can be rewritten in terms of a function that checks if an answer is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before seeing how to do this on a quantum computer, we need to introduce a couple of new operations. \n",
