Notebooks that explore how to use quantum computers to create random numbers

This set of Jupyter Notebooks is to support my blog posts on getting starting with quantum computing. I wanted to see if I could explain 
quantum computing without having to use [Bloch Spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), [circuit notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit) 
or deep mathematics, since I feel these create a false intuition around how qubits work. For instance, Block Spheres do not show entanglement, 
and circuit notation implies control travelling in one direction so misses phase kickbacks. Deep mathematics (by which I mean the combination of 
[Dirac notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation), complex numbers and [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)), 
while the most accurate representation, makes the topic inaccessible for many.

The [IBM Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) quantum computing library is used for the code exercises in the notebooks.
